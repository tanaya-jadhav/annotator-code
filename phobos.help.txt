Where: 

   -M <exact|extendExact|imperfect>,  --searchMode <exact|extendExact
      |imperfect>
     (value required)  Phobos provides three different search modes. exact:
     Search for exact repeats, only. extendExact: Searches for exact
     repeats and extends them by inserting mismatches and indels.
     imperfect: Searches directly for imperfect repeats.

   -g <int>,  --indelScore <int>
     (value required)  Score for indels - must be negative. Default: -5.
     Match score is fixed to one.

   -m <int>,  --mismatchScore <int>
     (value required)  Score for mismatch - must be negative. Default: -5.
     Match score is fixed to one.

   -s <int>,  --minScore <int>
     (value required)  The minimum score of a repeat is determined with:
     maximum( minScore, minScore_a + minScore_b*(unit-length) ). Default
     value of minScore: 6

   --minScore_a <int>
     (value required)  The minimum score of a repeat is determined with:
     maximum( minScore, minScore_a + minScore_b*(unit-length) ). Default
     value of minScore_a: 0

   --minScore_b <float>
     (value required)  The minimum score of a repeat is determined with:
     maximum( minScore, minScore_a + minScore_b*(unit-length) ). Default
     value of minScore_b: 1

   -l <int>,  --minLength <int>
     (value required)  The minimum length of a repeat is determined with:
     maximum( minLength, minLength_a + minLength_b*(unit-length) ). Default
     value of minLength: 0

   --minLength_a <int>
     (value required)  The minimum length of a repeat is determined with:
     maximum( minLength, minLength_a + minLength_b*(unit-length) ). Default
     value of minLength_a: 0

   --minLength_b <float>
     (value required)  The minimum length of a repeat is determined with:
     maximum( minLength, minLength_a + minLength_b*(unit-length) ). Default
     value of minLength_b: 0

   -U <int>,  --maxUnitLen <int>
     (value required)  Maximum unit length. Default: 10

   -u <int>,  --minUnitLen <int>
     (value required)  Minimum unit length. Default: 1

   -r <int>,  --recursion <int>
     (value required)  The recursion depth used in the search. Values in
     the range 3 to 7 are recommended. A value of 0 implies a search for
     perfect repeats only.

   -R <int>,  --maximum_score_reduction <int>
     (value required)  The maximum amount the score can be reduced before
     search is aborded. Typical: 6*mismatch-penalty or infinite. Default:
     infinite

   --lastSeq <int>
     (value required)  Number of last sequence to be processed in this run.

   --firstSeq <int>
     (value required)  Number of first sequence to be processed in this
     run.

   -D,  --dontRemoveMostlyOverlapping
     Phobos sometimes finds repeats that partially or completely overlap
     with other repeats, e.g. if alignments with alternative repeat
     patterns exist at the same locus in a sequence. The default is to
     remove one of any two mostly overlapping repeats in favour of that
     repeat with the highest score. With this option, Phobos reports also
     repeats that mostly overlap with higher scoring repeats.

   --maxPerfection <float>
     (value required)  Maximum perfection of a satellites. Default: 100.

   --minPerfection <float>
     (value required)  Minimum perfection of a satellites. Default: 0.

   -f <int>,  --flanking <int>
     (value required)  If the satellite sequence is printed, this is the
     number of flanking nucleotides to be printed to the left and right of
     it. Default: 0

   --maskLower
     Writes the sequences to a file with the extension ".masked" in which
     repeats are masked by lower case letters. Currently, this option has
     the sometimes unwanted side effect of changing all ambiguity codes to
     Ns.

   --STAMPrun
     This option tells Phobos that it called from STAMP, which slighly
     alters the output, mostly to be backward compatible with older
     versions with less lines of output.

   --maskX
     Writes the sequences to a file with the extension ".masked" in which
     repeats are masked by the X character. Currently, this option has the
     sometimes unwanted side effect of changing all ambiguity codes to Ns.

   --outputFormat <int>
     (value required)  Phobos provides different output formats for
     printing the repeat information. 0: Phobos output format, 1: extended
     Phobos output format, 2: gff - general feature format, 3: one-per-line
     format, 4: as fasta sequence

   --printRepeatSeqMode <int>
     (value required)  Phobos provides different modes to print the repeat
     sequence along with its information. 0: don't print sequence, 1: print
     sequence, 2: print alignment.

   --NPerfectionMode <int>
     (value required)  Phobos provides different modes to treat N's when
     computing the perfection of a repeat. 0: asMismatch, 1: asNeutral, 2:
     asMatch. Default: 0

   --reportUnit <int>
     (value required)  Repeat units can be reported in three different
     modes. 0: asIs, 1: Alphabetical normal form, 2: Alphabetical normal
     form also considering the reverse complement. Default: 2

   --preferShorterRepeats
     For two alignments of the same repeat that have the same score, Phobos
     reports by default (since version 3.3.9) the longer alignment. The
     longer alignment will have more mismatches/gaps and a lower
     perfection. With this option, Phobos will choose the shorter of the
     two alignments instead of the longer. Phobos will run faster with this
     option.

   --NsAsMissense
     Treat N's as missense. Default: Treat N's as neutral with score 0.

   -N <int>,  --succN <int>
     (value required)  The maximum number of successive N's allowed in a
     satellite. Default: 2.

   --sequenceInfoAsComment
     In the GFF and one-per-line output modes, show additional sequence
     information in the output file as a comment.

   --convert_gaps_to_Ns
     Some basecaller introduce gaps which naturally should be Ns.With this
     option we convert gaps to Ns. Otherwise gaps are excised from the
     sequence. (The '*' characters, which was introduced in some older
     programs is treated in the same way as gaps.)

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   -v,  --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <Input and output filenames>  (accepted multiple times)
     (value required)  Phobos requires either one or two file names as
     parameters. The first must be the input file in FASTA format. If a
     second file is specified, output is written to it. If no second file
     is given, output is written to the console. 


   This program searches for tandemly repeated patterns in DNA sequences.
